## My Guide to deploying ELK as an Incident Response Tool

## Import Bro logs from SecurityOnion into Logstash

The files in this repo are intended to create a modular workflow that is easy to modify and debug.  The normal logstash data pipeline consists of *input->filter->output*. Normally all filters, inputs, and outputs  are connected unless you control the message routing with tags.

Clone the repo into your logstash config directory (*/etc/logstash*) and build your configuration from softlinks. To create a workflow you need to have an input, filter, and output. It uses the same idea Debian has for Apache configuration.

Since Bro has many different file types, a partial match is done to classify the Bro log type (*20_filter-preprocessor-bro.conf*). This partial match is used then to process the log with an appropiate filter.

The postprocessor filter deletes any entry with the *_grokparsefailure* tag.  If you are debugging or developing new filters delete this postprocessor temporarly.  If you do this, then (*30_output-elasticsearch.conf*) will send debugging output to the default logstash log directory (*/var/log/logstash*) with the name *YYYY-MM-dd-BRO.err*

## Example

You want to ingest *bro_conn* logs from the SecurityOnion into Logstash. The first step is to modify *syslog-ng.conf*
in the sensor that has the logs you want to ingest. The destination IP address is the host where logstash is running.

```
destination d_bronion { udp("1.2.3.4" port("5514"));};
log {
  source(s_bro_conn);
  destination(d_bronion);
};
```

Then proceed to build your configuration on the host that is running logstash

```shell
cd /etc/logstash
ln -s policy/bro/10_input-udp-5514.conf conf.d/10_input-udp-5514.conf
ln -s policy/bro/23_filter-garbage-bro.conf
ln -s policy/bro/20_filter-preprocessor-bro.conf conf.d/20_filter-preprocessor-bro.conf
ln -s policy/bro/25_filter-bro-conn.conf conf.d/policy/21_filter-bro-conn.conf
ln -s policy/bro/27_filter-convertprocessor-bro.conf
ln -s policy/bro/28_filter-postprocessor-bro.conf conf.d/29_filter-postprocessor-bro.conf
ln -s policy/bro/30_output-elasticsearch.conf conf.d/30_output-elasticsearch.conf
service logstash restart
```
