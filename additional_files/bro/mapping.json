# This file gives you the elasticsearch index template to use to ensure that your brolog entry strings
# aren't parsed into tokens.  This means you cannot expect to quickly search for sub parts of the strings
# listed below.  It also means that weird things won't happen (like mime_type of application/x-tar
# being tokenized into 'application' 'x' 'tar' or IPV6 address being tokenized into 8 tokens.

# NOTE: you should apply this prior to starting to enter data.  Recommend creating an index that matches the 
# template regex below to make sure you don't get an error.  If you do something is wrong below.

# mime_type and filename have been tested, last time I used logstash to convert variables to integers
# which worked just fine.  I would recommend doing that whenever possible, though I don't think you can
# tell elastic search to not analyze with logstash.

# the best way to use this file is to resave without the comments and then use the command
# curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/template_1 -d @mappings.json
# where template_1 is the name of your template
